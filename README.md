# HealthKitRPC

A friend jokingly suggested to have my heart rate visible on Discord. Well...
![It works!](https://owo.whats-th.is/8QAFHw3.png)

Full of sample code and broken things.

## Usage
1. Change various bundle IDs and permit HealthKit access for the bundle ID. You'll need a paid Apple Developer account in order to do so.
2. Build HeartRate and run it on your iPhone. It was considered to use WatchConnectivity originally for real-time information from an Apple Watch, but that was effort.
3. Build HeartRateRPC and run it on your Mac. It will use MultipeerConnectivity.

NOTICE: If you unironically use this, please reconsider using it. It's never okay to needlessly give away private information.
